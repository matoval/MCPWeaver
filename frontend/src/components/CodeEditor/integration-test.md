## Sample Files Generated

The system includes sample generated MCP server files:

1. **main.go** - Complete MCP server implementation with JSON-RPC handling
2. **go.mod** - Go module definition with dependencies
3. **README.md** - Documentation with usage instructions
4. **Dockerfile** - Multi-stage Docker build configuration
5. **docs/api.md** - API documentation (in subdirectory)

## Integration Points

### With Backend (Future)
- File loading from generated server output
- Real-time validation using Go compiler
- Save operations to file system
- Project-specific file management

### With Project System
- Integration with ProjectView component
- Loading files based on project generation results
- File history and versioning
- Project-specific editor settings

### With Validation System
- Real-time Go syntax checking
- Integration with Go toolchain (gofmt, go vet)
- Error reporting and suggestions
- Code quality metrics

## Performance Considerations

- Monaco Editor lazy loading
- File tree virtualization for large projects
- Diff computation optimization
- Memory management for multiple tabs
- Responsive UI for large files

## Browser Compatibility
